* KYC stands for `Know Your Customer` and is a typical mandatory process, enforced by financial regulations, used to verify the identity of users opening a bank account.

* The **KYC.sol** contract allows App owners to validate they are the legitimate owners of the App they are trying to onboard.

* It is designed to work in 2 steps: first, the App owner calls **applyFor()** to submit a KYC application, and later calls **onboardWithSig()** to prove its identity through a cryptographic signature.

* The mechanism used by **onboardWithSig()**, however, is not protected against a well-known signature validation attack. It calls **recoverSigner()** which mistakenly accepts as valid a signature of the right size but with the last bytes different from 27 or 28, and returns address 0x0 as the signer.

* Because address 0x0 is always whitelisted although it shouldn't, **onboardWithSig()** will accept the App even if it is not its owner who's running it. This way, totally defeating the purpose of KYC.

This is what the POC execution will show:

```
% npx hardhat run pocs/6.js

Exploit POC : 

User 1 signature was: 
0x6970c37456a9770034237505b823aafee5a7930a34b46f3be19e8915e7b2ccc75d652d4cebf7502a7b0ac562cd78afef63b3f4d72027fc4463245aa81adfeda11b
The Attacker reuses User 1 signature, except the last 2 bytes must be different than 0x1b (v=27) and 0x1c (v=28).
0x6970c37456a9770034237505b823aafee5a7930a34b46f3be19e8915e7b2ccc75d652d4cebf7502a7b0ac562cd78afef63b3f4d72027fc4463245aa81adfeda1ff
Attack successful: the Attacker onboarded App2 without User 2's approval.
```
