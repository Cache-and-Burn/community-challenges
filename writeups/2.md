**Staking** contract allows users to stake their `IERC223(token)` tokens , Contract allow users to withdraw their staked `tokens` after a lock-period of 7 days elapsed and the protocol sends the **reward** in Native(ETH) the staker.


* Whenever you transfer the tokens to the Staking contract. ERC223 token `transfer(..)` function makes the callback to the recipient `Staking` contract as can be seen here:

https://github.com/immunefi-team/community-challenges/blob/master/contracts/tokens/MockERC223.sol#L78

```js
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes calldata _data) public override returns (bool success)
    {
        // Standard function transfer similar to ERC20 transfer with no _data .
        // Added due to backwards compatibility reasons .
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] - _value;
        balances[_to] = balances[_to] + _value;
        if(Address.isContract(_to)) {
            IERC223Recipient(_to).tokenReceived(msg.sender, _value, _data);
        }
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        emit TransferData(_data);
        return true;
    }
```

* the staking contract takes the callback via **tokenReceived(address,uint256,bytes)** function and calls the internal **_stake(_from, _amount)**

https://github.com/immunefi-team/community-challenges/blob/master/contracts/vulnerable/Staking.sol#L50

* Vulnerability lies under the **unstake()** function when the transfer call occurs from the staking contract to the staker EOA.x
  a. Contract first transfers `amount` the ERC223 tokens to the `msg.sender`.
  b. Then updates the `balances[]` mapping with the transferred amount from the current balance.

```js
token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
balances[msg.sender] = userBal - amount;
```

* What could go wrong if the `msg.sender` here is the contract but not the EOA?
* As we have previously seen, ERC223 tokens have a special logic in their `transfer()` function where they do a callback to the recipient address if the recipient is contract. 
* If the staker here is the malicious **contracts/malicious/ERC223Reentrant.sol** contract, then by the callback, Malicious contract can reenter into the staking contract by calling **unstake()** function, which ends up transferring the tokens again to the **msg.sender**.

```js
token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
```

https://github.com/immunefi-team/community-challenges/blob/master/contracts/malicious/ERC223Reentrant.sol#L40

* Using the described loophole, The malicious contract can drain all the ERC223 tokens deposited in the **Staking** contract.
* The following POC of the challenge demonstrates the same behavior.
