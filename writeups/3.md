**Takeover** contract allow users to deposit and withdraw **1 ether** for each call.
* **changeOwner()** function has `onlyAuth` modifier which allows the call only if:
    a. `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract. [or]
    b. `msg.sender` is address(this) itself.

```js
    function changeOwner(address newOwner) external onlyAuth {
        require(newOwner != address(0), "no address(0)");
        require(newOwner != owner, "no current owner");
        emit OwnershipChanged(owner, newOwner);
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```


* Contract has an function **staticall()** which takes the target `address`, bytes `payload` arguments.
    a. function checks if the `target` address supplied is contract.
    b. function then makes a call from `address(target)` along with the data supplied.


```js
    function staticall(
        address target,
        bytes memory payload,
        string memory errorMessage
    ) external returns (bytes memory) {
        require(isContract(target), "call to non-contract");
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = address(target).call(payload);
```

* Attacker can build the arguments with target pointing to `address(this)` along with the payload pointing to the `changeOwner(attacker.address)` function which fullfills the requirement of the `onlyAuth()` modifier as `msg.sender` will be `address(this)`.

* Following POC demonstrate how to build the payload `bytes` data
