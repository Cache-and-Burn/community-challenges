* As per the EIP20, `transfer()` function should `throw`, If the msg.sender(caller) doesn't have enough tokens to transfer to the recipient.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20

> Transfers _value amount of tokens to address _to, and MUST fire the Transfer event. The function SHOULD throw if the message callerâ€™s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend

* This opens up the discussion over how the errors in token transfers should be handled. 
* There are two(2) options:  
 
    1. `Revert`: a reversion in solidity is equivalent to throwing an exception.  This means that the execution state of a transaction is rolled up as if it never happened.
    
    2. `Return False`: The called function returns a value of `false`, allowing the calling function to perform error handling.

* The community had not come to an agreement on which error handling method to choose, meaning that both options are considered **valid**.  This places the burden on the developer to ensure that their code properly handles errors.
* The majority of the ERC20 tokens in the space opts for `revert()` since they consider it the safer way.
* There are a lot of tokens in the space which handles the `transfer()` differently from the standard implementation.
* Instead of reverting the transaction, `transfer()` returns boolean output (`true or false`) indicating the success or failure of the transfer.

![Exchange attack](/community-challenges/assets/01.jpg "Exchange Attack")

* A few popular tokens that returns `bool` on transfers are BAT, ZRX tokens. The example in the challenge was taken from ZRX ERC20 implementation https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code

* If the contract integrating this type of tokens isn't checking the return values of the `transferFrom(..)` then it is possible for an attacker to drain the entire balance of the contract.

* POC of the challenge demonstrates how the attacker could drain the ETH balance of the `Exchange` contract without holding any of the ERC20 tokens.

```shell
npx hardhat run pocs/1.js
```

```
EXPLOIT:

token balance of {attacker} : 0.0
Before: ETH Balance {attacker} : 10000.0
After: ETH Balance {attacker} : 10049.999867500105713654
```

Problem can be mitigated by the following ways:


* Checking against the return bool value, by making sure the call to `transferFrom(..)` function returned `true`.

```
require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount),"false was returned");
```

* Using SafeERC20 wrapper from OpenZeppelin, which makes the static call to the contract and check against the return value.

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol

```
    function safeTransferFrom(
        IERC20 token,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value));
    }
```

```
    function _callOptionalReturn(IERC20 token, bytes memory data) private {
        // We need to perform a low level call here, to bypass Solidity's return data size checking mechanism, since
        // we're implementing it ourselves. We use {Address.functionCall} to perform this call, which verifies that
        // the target address contains contract code and also asserts for success in the low-level call.

        bytes memory returndata = address(token).functionCall(data, "SafeERC20: low-level call failed");
        if (returndata.length > 0) {
            // Return data is optional
            require(abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");
        }
    }
```
